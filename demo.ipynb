       "'The luxury cruise liner has it all! From state-of-the-art technology to elegant furnishings, this cabin is sure to impress even the most discerning traveler. The Sangean DT-110GC Digital Pocket AM/FM Stereo Receiver allows guests to enjoy music and radio programs while relaxing in comfort. With its 15 presets on both FM and AM stations, as well as three random settings, there’s no need to worry about missing out on any favorite shows. For those who prefer to listen privately, the included headphones are perfect for enjoying some quiet time. The Samsung TXN2775HF 27” HD-Ready TV with DynaFlat CRT Screen ensures that guests can watch movies and television shows in crystal clear quality. Its 27” display makes viewing more immersive and comfortable, while its DynaFlat screen reduces reflection and glare so guests won’t have to squint when watching their favorite show. Guests can also connect their own devices such as game consoles, camcorders, and computers via the side panel AV hookup. Finally, the Belkin HDDB15M to HDDB15F VGA Monitor Extension Cable-25 Feet allows guests to easily extend their monitors up to 25 feet away without sacrificing image clarity.'"
